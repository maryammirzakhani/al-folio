<P>Maryam Mirzakhani was a groundbreaking Iranian mathematician born in Tehran in 1977. As a teenager, she won two gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad, achieving a perfect score in 1995. She earned her Ph.D. from Harvard University, where she studied under Curtis McMullen and focused on hyperbolic geometry and related areas.<P>

<P>Her research connected several complex fields, including Riemann surfaces, moduli spaces, and Teichm√ºller theory. In 2014, she became the first woman and the first Iranian to win the Fields Medal, one of the highest honors in mathematics. Her work was known for its depth and for linking distant areas of math in innovative ways.<P>

<P>Mirzakhani had a unique, visual approach to problem-solving, often covering pages with sketches before formalizing ideas. She was a professor at Stanford and a mentor to many. She passed away from breast cancer in 2017, but her legacy continues to inspire future generations, especially women in science and math.<P>
